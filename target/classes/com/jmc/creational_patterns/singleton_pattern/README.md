Singleton Pattern
=================

Singleton pattern is a creational pattern.

This pattern involves only a single class which is responsible to creates its own object.

The class ensures that only single object get created.

This class provides a way to access its only object.

For example, when design a user interface, we may only have one main application windows. We can use the Singleton Pattern to ensure that there is only one instance of the MainApplicationWindow object.


Example
-------------------
* The following code is going to create a MainWindow class.

* MainWindow class have its constructor as private and have a static instance of itself.

* MainWindow class provides a static method to get its static instance to outside world.

* Main, our demo class will use MainWindow class to get a MainWindow object.

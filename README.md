Java Design Pattern Introduction
==========================
A design pattern is a **well-proved solution** <i class="icon-cog"></i> for solving the specific problem/task. 

For example, to create a class for which only a single instance should be created and that single object can be used by all other classes, use Singleton design pattern.

Design patterns are programming language independent, it is for solving the common object-oriented design problems.

A design pattern represents an idea, not an implementation. By using the design patterns we can make our code more flexible, reusable and maintainable. 
Java itself internally follows design patterns.

Design Patterns
-------------

In core java, there are mainly three types of design patterns, which are further divided into their sub-parts:

>**Creational Design Pattern**
1. [Factory Pattern](src/main/java/com/jmc/creational_patterns/factory_pattern)
2. [Abstract Factory Pattern](src/main/java/com/jmc/creational_patterns/abstract_pattern)
3. [Singleton Pattern](src/main/java/com/jmc/creational_patterns/singleton_pattern)
4. [Prototype Pattern](src/main/java/com/jmc/creational_patterns/prototype_pattern)
5. [Builder Pattern](src/main/java/com/jmc/creational_patterns/builder_pattern)
>**Structural Design Pattern**
1. [Adapter Pattern](src/main/java/com/jmc/structural_patterns/adapter_pattern)
2. [Bridge Pattern](src/main/java/com/jmc/structural_patterns/bridge_pattern)
3. [Filter Pattern](src/main/java/com/jmc/structural_patterns/filter_pattern)
3. Composite Pattern
4. [Decorator Pattern](src/main/java/com/jmc/structural_patterns/decorator_pattern)
5. Facade Pattern
6. Flyweight Pattern
7. Proxy Pattern
>**Behavioral Design Pattern (check out the**
1. Chain Of Responsibility Pattern
2. Command Pattern
3. Interpreter Pattern
4. Iterator Pattern
5. Mediator Pattern
6. Memento Pattern
7. Observer Pattern
8. State Pattern
8. Strategy Pattern
9. Template Pattern
10. Visitor Pattern
